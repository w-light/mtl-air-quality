An analysis of air pollution equity in Montreal, made for ENVS653 GIS for Environmental Assessment.

## Executive Summary  
Within the field of air pollution studies, an increasing area of interest is pollution equity, defined by Tessum et al. (2019) as the “difference in the environmental health damage caused by a racial-ethnic group and the damage that group experiences.” Studies so far indicate that socioeconomically advantaged groups tend to commit more damage than they experience. Using a variant of the pollution equity idea that takes into account climate change-related emissions, we explore whether this phenomenon exists in the Greater Montreal area.

Specifically, we examine the level of air-pollution exposure risk across the city and suburbs of Laval and Longueuil and relate them to average household emissions of pollutants—greenhouse gases (GHG). The aim is to assess whether the burden of air pollution is equitably shared across neighbourhoods, regardless of income and private vehicle usage, or some high emitters evade air pollution while low emitters reside in more highly polluted areas. 

We accomplished this by creating two maps, one representing the potential for air pollution exposure, and one representing GHG emissions, each at the level of the census dissemination area (DA). The air pollution potential map was constructed with data on land use, point source pollution, surface temperature, and road network proximity. The GHG emissions map was built with combined income and private vehicle usage data as a proxy for GHG emissions. We then related GHG emissions to pollution exposure risk in a bivariate map. 

Our analysis suggests several spatially correlated trends. Primarily, it was evident that suburban areas outside of the island of Montreal represent high household GHG emissions and low pollution exposure. This trend of high emissions and low risk pollution exposure is also present in central high-income residential areas in Montreal, such as Notre-Dame de Grace and Westmount, as well as some of the neighborhoods surrounding Parc Mont Royal. We also discerned a distinction between the east and west ends of the island. The east generally represents higher exposure to pollutants than the west. Overall, this analysis points out several spatial trends in which we find evidence of unequal burdens of exposure risk.
